AdminBased Rewriter Simulator

####When people think of .htaccess configuration, the first thing that might pop into their minds is URL manipulation with mod_rewrite. But they're often frustrated by mod_rewrite's complexity.

With this Mod_Rewrite Simulator you can:

Define routes in the admin panel
Easily transform ugly, cryptic URLs into what are known as "friendly URLs"
Manage all your URLs from one single location
Manipulate and test your URLs on the fly
Make your website more search engine friendly
Make your website more secure by transforming your URLs
Easily transform ugly, cryptic URLs into what are known as "friendly URLs"
Whether you're a small business or a large brand, Leadership board fan page app provides a simple and effective way to promote your page.

Manage all your URLs from one single location
With this application, you don't need to open your .htaccess file to add a new re-rewrite rule. You can add and modified your URLs from a nice control panel.

Manipulate and test your URLs on the fly
You can manipulate and test your URLs without going through the regors of uploading .htaccess files for each re-write manipulation.

Make your website more search engine friendly
Even better:   http://example.com/user/Joe/ 

Not only is the above link easier on the eyes, it's also possible for search engines to extract semantic meaning from it. This basic kind of URL rewriting is one way that Mod_rewrite Simulator is used.

Make your website more secure by transforming your URLs
http://example.com/user.php?id=AHHHHHH 
 
>http://example.com/user/AHHHHHH/

Given the same example, imagine the following attack on the user id. In the first example, the PHP script is explicitly being invoked and must handle the invalid id number. A poorly written script would likely fail, and, in a more extreme case (in a poorly written web application), bad input could cause data corruption. However, if the user is only ever shown the friendlier URLs. they would never know that the user.php page existed.
Trying the same attack in that case would likely fail before it even reaches the PHP script. This is because, at the core of mod_rewrite is regular expression pattern matching. In the example case above, you would have been expecting a number, for example (\d+), not characters like a-z. This extra layer of abstraction is nice from a security perspective.

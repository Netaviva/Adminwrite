<h2>When people think of .htaccess configuration, the first thing that might pop into their minds is URL manipulation with mod_rewrite. But they're often frustrated by mod_rewrite's complexity.</h2>
<p>With this Mod_Rewrite Simulator you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Define routes in the admin panel</li>
  <li>Easily transform ugly, cryptic URLs into what are known as "friendly URLs" </li>
  <li>Manage all your URLs from one single location</li>
  <li>Manipulate and test your URLs on the fly</li>
  <li>Make your website more search engine friendly</li>
  <li>Make your website more secure by transforming your URLs</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Easily transform ugly, cryptic URLs into what are known as "friendly URLs"</strong><br />
Whether you're a small business or a large brand, Leadership board fan page app provides a simple and effective way to promote your page.</p>
<p><strong>Manage all your URLs from one single location</strong><br />
With this application, you don't need to open your .htaccess file to add a new re-rewrite rule. You can add and modified your URLs from a nice control panel.</p>
<p><strong>Manipulate and test your URLs on the fly</strong><br />
You can manipulate and test your URLs without going through the regors of uploading .htaccess files for each re-write manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>Make your website more search engine friendly</strong><br />
<pre name="code" class="php">
Even better:   http://example.com/user/Joe/ </br>
</pre>
Not only is the above link easier on the eyes, it's also possible for search engines to extract semantic meaning from it. This basic kind of URL rewriting is one way that Mod_rewrite Simulator is used.</p><br />
<p><strong>Make your website more secure by transforming your URLs</strong><br />
<pre name="code" class="php">
http://example.com/user.php?id=AHHHHHH <br> 
>http://example.com/user/AHHHHHH/</br>
</pre>
Given the same example, imagine the following attack on the user id. In the first example, the PHP script is explicitly being invoked and must handle the invalid id number. A poorly written script would likely fail, and, in a more extreme case (in a poorly written web application), bad input could cause data corruption. However, if the user is only ever shown the friendlier URLs. they would never know that the user.php page existed.<br>
Trying the same attack in that case would likely fail before it even reaches the PHP script. This is because, at the core of mod_rewrite is regular expression pattern matching. In the example case above, you would have been expecting a number, for example (\d+), not characters like a-z. This extra layer of abstraction is nice from a security perspective.</p>

<h3 id="install"><strong>D) </strong><strong>How to Install</strong>- <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
<p>AdminBased Rewrite Simulator is very easy to install and use. These are the steps that you need in installing this component.
<ul>
<li>1. Just copy the "adminrewrite" folder and ".htaccess" file to the root directory of your website. If you have ".htaccess" file already in your root directory, simply overwrite that with the one you contained in your downloaded package.
<p>Note: If your website is in another Directory (Subfolder), please ensure that you add the name of your directory to the ErrorDocument 404 path to reflect the subfolder as show below
<blockquote>
ErrorDocument 404 /DirectoryName/adminrewrite/rewrite.php
</blockquote> </p>
</li>

<li>2. Open the folder "adminrewrite" and open the file "admin.php". Look at line 12 and 13. There you can change the admin login details to the one you desired </br>
<blockquote>
// Admin Security
$sUsername = 'admin';</br>
$sPassword = 'admin';
</blockquote></li>
<li>3. Login to the admin panel by typing http://www.yourdomain.com/adminrewrite/admin.php. Use your new login details to login into the rewrite panel.
<li>4. After loggin into the admin panel. Ensure that the Rewrite Base is having the foward slash "/". 
<p>Note: If you installed this in a subfolder either than your root folder. Add the name of the folder with a foward slash in front of it as show below.
<blockquote>
/DirectoryName/
</blockquote> </p>

<hr>
<h3 id="settings"><strong>E) settings</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above you can manage your URLs settings from the admin panel.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/rewrite_cpanel.png" alt="" width="780"></p>
After loggin into the admin panel. Ensure that the Rewrite Base is having the foward slash "/". 
<p>Note: If you installed this in a subfolder either than your root folder. Add the name of the folder with a foward slash in front of it as show below.
<blockquote>
/DirectoryName/

<h3 id="createurl"><strong>How to Use</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

Below you will find a small example of how to use this script. This is just to show how easy it is to use 

this script.

After installing the script by just copying the package into your project. Login into the admin panel and starting setting your rules. 
There are three fields that needs to be filled when adding a rule.
Example: 
<pre>
<blockquote>cash money.php [L] </blockquote>
</pre>

1. Expression:  This is where you insert your regular expressions. A regular expression is basically a small piece of code that checks for patterns. The pattern can range from a single character that matches to absolutely everything.

In the example above, the Expression Pattern is <blockquote> cash </blockquote>. In this version, we have built the Regular Expressions that is normally encountered in web projects into our Rewrite Class. In that case, you don't have to worry about any regular expression. As stated above, 
<ul>
<li>If you want a page "cash" to redirect to money.php, just use expression : <strong>cash</strong></li>
<li>If you want only numeric characters, as in blog/browse/1/ or blog/browse/24/, use expression: <strong>blog/browse/:int:/</strong></li>
<li>If i want to redirect u/username/ to profile.php?user=username, you will just use expression: <strong>u/:alnum:/
</strong></li>
</ul>
</br>
2. Redirect: The redirect is the URL that is substituted for the request. If the pattern above matches the request, Apache uses this URL instead of the requested URL.
In the example above the redirect is <blockquote>money.php</blockquote>

3.Flag: "Flags", tell Apache how to apply the rule. In the above example, the flag is <blockquote>L</blockquote>. This stands for Last rule. Meaning as soon as this flag is read, no other following rules are processed. 

<strong>Important Note</strong>
In this new version, there are predefined regular expressions bulit into our rewrite engine. Supported named expression are;
<ul>
<li>numbers only -> :int: or :integer:</li>
<li>only string -> :alpha:</li>
<li>string and numbers -> :alnum: or :alphanum: or :alphanumeric:</li>
<li>anything -> :any:</li>
</ul>

An example on how to use to them is as follows.
Assuming you want <strong>blog/view/1/</strong> to redirect to <strong> blog.php?page=$1</strong>, you use the expression: 
<pre><strong> blog/view/:int:/</strong></pre>
You can find more information about regular expression and mod_rewrite here.
